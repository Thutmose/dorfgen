Dorfgen Usage information
-------------------------

exportconstructs.lua and exportsites.lua are used to generate constructs.txt and sites.txt, they are to be run via dfhack.

the contents of the zip were generated by running the above mentioned lua scripts, as well as "exportlegends all" in dfhack, then running the process legends exports via LNP. 

The contents of the zip go into config/dorfgen.

the trunc xmls are generated if you place the ones from exportlegends into the dorfgen config folder, they are the legends and legends plus xmls with all of the entity/artifact data removed, to greatly reduce the file size.
